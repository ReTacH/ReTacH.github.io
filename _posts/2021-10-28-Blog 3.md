In this blog post, we will create a *cool* webapp that creates a simple message bank. Here, this app should allow the user to submit messages to the bank and allow the user to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank. 

For completion, you can click the link below to access my project repository in case you want to implement it by yourself: [https://github.com/ReTacH/flask_blogpost](https://github.com/ReTacH/flask_blogpost). Most structures of our webapp will be based on Phil's cool repository given here: [flask-examples](https://github.com/PIC16B/flask-examples). let's dig in! 

## Creating Templates
**First**, we will create a *base.html* to build a base web which we can extend into others later:

 ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW3_base.png)

While there are *quite* a bit of HTML stuffs going on here, the **main** things are the following:
- For the *title* of the webapp, we put in **PIC16B Blog Post 3** at the top.
- In the *h1* component, we name our app as **A Simple Message Bank**.
- In the *li* component, we create two hyperlinks which points to our **Submit** and **View** templates.
- Also, we include our *stylesheet* to the file **style.css** which governs our cosmetics for the app. 

**Second**, we create a *submit.html* which allows the user to submit their name and messages

Ok, now let's go over the main points of this troublesome HTML file:
- First, we extend this *submit.html* file from our previous base file to have the same structure
- In the *h1* component, we name this page as **Submit**
- Now, for the main components, we wish for the user to type in their name and some messages. Thus, we will embed the following HTML insides the **POST** method to tell the app that we are getting some information. The *label* components create the instruction texts "Your Message" and "Your name or handle" for us; on the other hand, the *input* components create a slot to input the variables for "message" and "name". At last, we also create another *input* component for the submit button of our form as well
- In addition, if the user successfully submit the form, we create our HTML block to thank the user as well.   

**Third**, we create our last template *view.html* which allow the user to view a sample of the messages currently stored in the bank.

Cool, this last template is a bit shorter than our previous templates, let's take a look:
- As usual, we extend our template from the base one to get the same features. Also, we name this page as **Some Cool Messages** in our *h1* components.  
- Now, assume we have some messages that we have extracted from our bank (we will go over the function which could randomly extract it later). We wish to display it here in this page. We exploit the fact that Jinja tags support looping and indexing of objects so that if `m` is a tuple of user handle and message, `m[0]` contains the handle and `m[1]` contains the message. Thus, we loop over the messages and put them in the component *p*, done! 

## Building the functions and routings in app.py
Without doubt, the core of our webapp lies in the file *app.py*. This file will let us connects the web development with Python using Flask. First, we initialize the file as follows:  
```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request, current_app
import sqlite3
app = Flask(__name__)
```
à¹ŒNow, it's time to go on our journey in creating functions and routes for our app.

The first function we consider is the **get_message_db** as shown below.
```python
def get_message_db():
	if 'message_db' not in g:
		g.message_db = sqlite3.connect('message_db.sqlite')

	with current_app.open_resource('init.sql') as f:
		g.message_db.executescript(f.read().decode('utf8'))

	return g.message_db
```
This function handles creating database of messages for our app. Here, we check whether the database 'message_db' is in the g attribute of the app or not. If not, then we use the sqlite3 to connect to that database. Next, we shall check whether there is a table called 'messages' or not. Here, we create our SQL command in the file *'init.sql'* as follows:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  handle TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL );
```
Here, we use the command `current_app.open_resource` to execute this SQL and create a table containing table an id column (integer), a handle column (text), and a message column (text). Note that we add the extra command AUTOINCREMENT to ensure that the id is update if we add new row of data.

Next, assume the user type in the message in our previous *submit.html* site, we wish to insert these data into our database. We do this by creating a function **insert_message(request)**:
```python
def insert_message(request):
	name = request.form['name']
	message = request.form['message']
	db = get_message_db()
	db.execute(
		'INSERT INTO messages (handle, message) VALUES (?, ?)',
		(name, message)
		)
	db.commit()
	g.pop('message_db', None)
	db.close()
```
This function request the 'name' and 'message' and variable that the user put it in the submit.html site. We then connect to our database *db* using our function get_message_db() we define previously; we execute the SQL commands above to insert the name and message into our messages table. At last, we close our connection to database by using the method `g.pop` and `db.close()`. Note that we don't need to specify the id when we insert it into our database as we already initialized our database with id AUTOINCREMENT.

After we have created a function for user to submit messages to the database, we also want the user to be able to see the messages they have already submitted. In this sense, we create a **random_messages** functions which random a fixed number of messages from our database. We can do this straightaway by connecting to the database using the previously defined get_message_db() and executing the SQL queries with RANDOM() method as shown below:
```python
def random_messages(n):
	db = get_message_db()
	rdm_message = db.execute(
		f'SELECT handle, message 
        FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT {n}'
		).fetchall()
	return rdm_message
```

Now, we are all set with necessary functions for our webapp. The rest of our functions are just routing the application to where it should be. First, suppose we open our application, we want it to displays the *base.html* template. We can do this directly by returning the `render_template('base.html')`
```python
@app.route('/')
def main():
    return render_template('base.html')
```

Next, we route our application to the submission part. Since this page will both transmit and receive data, we support both POST and GET methods In the GET case, we just render the *submit.html* template with no other parameters. In the POST case, we call the *insert_message()* to put in the messages in our database and then render the *submit.html* template. In addition, we add a small note thanking the user for their submission.
```python
@app.route('/submit/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else:
        insert_message(request)
        return render_template('submit.html', thanks = True)
```

Lastly, we construct a route to the view page. In this page, we first call the function *random_message* to grab some random messages from our database (Here, I set the cap for the number of messages to 5). Afterward, we pass these message as an argument to the *render_template* method to show it in our page.
```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():
	rdm = random_messages(5)
	return render_template('view.html', messages = rdm)
```

Finally, we are done with our functions! In addition, I also configured stuffs in the *style.css* to make our app looks a bit *cooler*. Now, let's see what our app looks like!
## Webapp Demonstrations
To run our application, we first needs to call `flask run` in our directory of the project. After that, we can navigate to our local host sites and see our **cool** applications!

Let's try to submit our messages in this **submit** page: 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW3_submit_pic.png)

Ok, Let's look at some *cool* messages we have in the **view** page:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW3_view_pic.png)

Oof, it seems I got caught that I've also been playing around with other submission before this one. In any case, our application now looks cool and good to go!
