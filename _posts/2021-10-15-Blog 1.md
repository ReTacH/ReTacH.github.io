In this blog post, we will talk about how to create several interesting, interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate dataset.

## Create a Database
First, we will need to do the most important lines in Python: *import modules*. While a couple of these modules may not be familiar for us right now, we will soon get used to them in a second! Hold your hand tight!
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sqlite3 
from plotly import express as px
import plotly.io as pio
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```
To create a database, we first need to create a *connection* to the database by running the line `conn = sqlite3.connect("hw1.db")`. If this database does not exist, then it will connect it automatically. Here, we begin our creation of the database by preparing the temperature data in the file `"temp.csv"` using the code below; this gives an easier access to temperature values for each month of the stations we are looking at. After we finished cleaning up the data a bit, we use the `df.to_sql` commands to read our data in a chunk of size 100000 into the database with the help of our iteration methods.

```python
def prepare_df(df):
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)

df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```
**Yes!** Now we have our temperature data on our database. Similarly, using the same commands, we can input the *stations* data and the *countries* data into our database by the following codes:
```python
url1 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B
        /master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url1)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
url2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze
        /master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(url2)
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```
Now, we have all the data we want. **Beware!** don't forget to close your connection to the database with the command `conn.close()`. Else, someone might infiltrate your database when you are asleep! ( *just kidding* )
## Write a Query Function
Here, we write an Sql query function which extracts the temperature data out of our database! We do this by reconnect to our database (which we have just closed, *lol*). We select the temperature data we want from the combined table between the temperatures, stations, and countries using the *JOIN* method, where we join the table using the common station name. In addition, the data we seek needs to satisfy our input country, year_begin, year_end, and month; this could be done with addition of *WHERE* line. Altogether, we get the dataframe back by calling the pandas `pd.read_sql_query` command, **Easy right?**

It's been a while since we see our dataset, so let's extract the temperature data from **India** between the year of **1980-2020** on **January**; we do this by calling our functions we have just created:
```python
df = query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
df
```

**Perfect!** We have gotten the latitude, longitude, and temperature for each of the station located in India from the year 1980 to 2020. It's time to use our newly learned plotly modules to visualize these data.
## Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases
First, we create a small auxiliary function which use linear regression on the temperature of each station to predict its estimate yearly increases in temperature (that is, we calculate the *slope* for the line of best fit):
```python
def coef(data_group):
    x = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x,y)
    return LR.coef_[0]
```
Next, we will create a function which plots the estimated yearly increase in the temperature for stations observed in a specific country, specific range of years, and specific months as shown below. While this code looks a little daunting, actually the hard works are all done using the **plotly** modules, the rest are just data preparations.

Now, let's test our code by plotting the estimate yearly increase in temperature in **India** between **1980-2020** in January
```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r 
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)
fig.show()
```
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_4.png)
**Cool!** Now we have created an interactive figure where we could hover around each point to see its station name, latitude,
longitude, and estimate yearly increase in temperature in January between 1980 to 2020, pretty nice isn't it?
## More Interesting Figures
Next, we create more figures to gain more insight about the temperatures in India we have been looking. First, we would like to see whether the latitude/longitude or the temperatures tell us anything about the estimated yearly increase in temperature we observed in previous plot or not. Therefore, we create a scatter plot by consider two facets of whether the estimated yearly increase in temperature is positive or negative; our code is given below:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_5.png)
As usual, we test our newly-defined function on the data in **India** from 1980-2020 in January. Note also that we create a box plot in X-axis as well to see how the marginal distribution behave.
```python
fig = splitting_signs_coefficients_plot("India", 1980, 
                            2020, 1, marginal_x = "box")
fig.show()
```
As expect, we first see that as the latitude increases, the color gets more blue (Going north should be *colder* right?). One interesting thing we see from the box plot here is that the stations which have negative sign of estimate yearly increases in temperature have a median around 25 latitude while the stations which have positive sign of estimate yearly increases in temperature have a median around 20 latitude. This seems to imply that, due to global warming, the **warm** area seems to get **warmer** while the **cold** area seems to also get **colder**; this dichotomy seems like warning issue which we should try to fix real quick!

However, one aspect that our data set does not contain is the **altitude**. This might make the temperature changes drastically even if two stations are close to each other with respect to the latitude and longitude. As such, we consider a contour plot to see how the estimate yearly increases in temperature would depends on latitude/longitude or other factors. Note that the following code is similar to the one we had before in our two-facets scatter plots:
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_7.png)
```python
fig = contour_temp_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1)
fig.show()
```
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HW1_8.png)

Here, when we set the bin for both longitude and latitude as 5, we see a contour for the two facets of the data we are looking. For the stations which have an estimate yearly decrease in temperatures, they tend to cluster around one area. On the other hand, the stations which have an estimate yearly increases in temperatures cluster in two specific regions. It is of interest to investigate further with other demographical datasets to see the features of these clustering we observed in our visualization. For example, maybe the region on the left plot might be the mountain areas or the regions on the right plot might be the city areas. In any case, our complex visualizations in this blog shows couple interesting features which could be a starting point for many more future research directions.
