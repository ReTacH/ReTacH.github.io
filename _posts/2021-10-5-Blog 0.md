In this first blog post, we will talk about how to create one interesting data visualization of the **Palmer Penguin** data set. Here, we will use modules called "**pandas**" and "**seaborn**." For those who are no familiar with these modules, **pandas** is an excellent module to work with large amount of tabular data, usually in the form of dataframe. **seaborn** is a powerful module which enable us to create a complex (and particularly *beautiful*!) visualization of datasets. 

# Data Exploration
First of all, we will need to do the most important lines in Python: *import modules*. Next, using the command `pd.read_csv`, we can directly extract our data from Phil Chodrow's website into our dataframes to be used with **pandas** right away. 
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
url = "https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Now, we already got our data in the "penguins" dataframe; however, we don't know how's the data look like. We can actually take a look at the first three rows of the data by using the command `penguins.head(3)`.

Great! now we have a big chunk of data which, not gonna lie, is too much for our cute data visualization. Since we are interested in the species of penguins in our data set, let's take a look at all the *unique* penguin species here. Fortunately, we don't need to loop over the dataframe or anything like that: pandas already have this kind of command for us!: just type `penguins["Species"].unique()`.

```python
array(['Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)',
       'Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)',
       'Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)'], dtype=object)
```

Well, we have three kind of penguins, but each species name is **too long**. Let's rename these penguins to make it shorter and, especially, make each species look cuter! 

```python
penguins_names = {'Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)': 'Adelie',
                  'Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)': 'Chinstrap', 
                  'Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)': 'Gentoo'}
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].replace(penguins_names)
```
# Data Visualization

Now, it's time to get some visualization out of our dataframe. Let's concentrate our analysis on two aspects of the penguin: **Culmen Length (mm)** and **Body Mass (g)**. Furthermore, to get a better understand on the habitat of each species, we shall visualize our data separately on the three available islands. As mentioned at the start, seaborn is an extremely powerful visualizer which can help us create a super cool plot in just one block of code:
```python
penguins_visual = sns.relplot(x = "Culmen Length (mm)", 
                            y = "Body Mass (g)", 
                            hue = "Species", 
                            data = penguins, 
                            col="Island", 
                            sizes=(100, 1000),
                            palette= "winter")
```

Nice! our plot shows a pretty clear clustering of each species of penguins on each island: Gentoo seems to be a big boy, with huge body mass and long culmen length, who only resides in Biscoe island, Chinstrap seems to be a lanky penguin, with normal body mass and long culmen length, who only resides in Dream island, and lastly, Adelie seems to be just a normal well-rounded penguin which we all love.
